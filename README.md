============

sonos volume control for mac os x status bar 

This is version alpha. A toy at this moment. Works well with one speaker hardcoded in so far.
I'm planning on adding room selector in next update.  

It's all based on this project: [sonos-objc](https://github.com/n1mda/sonos-objc "sonos-objc")
